# HeartRei
HeartRei Therapies is a holistic therapy business recently started by my mum. The website was initialy created using Wix. I found the design tooling inflexible, and the end product did not provide a smooth user experience. This static site is an attempt to provide an alternative.

## Objectives
* Refine my skills for working with modern HTML and CSS.
* Produce a viable replacement for the current Wix website.

## What I Learned
* The basics of **responsive design**. How to use media queries to adjust the styling based on the dimensions of the users' device.
* How to use next generation image formats such as WEBP. 
  * Utilizing the `<picture>` element to provide multiple image formats as fallback options.
  * Using the **Modernizr** javascript library to detect browser compatibility from CSS.

## Future plans
* Create additional pages for about me and service details.
* Transition to a static site generator such as [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) to introduce dynamic content sources such as a blog, and a listing of upcoming events from Eventbrite.
